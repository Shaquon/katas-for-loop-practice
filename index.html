    <title>Katas For Loop Practice</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Katas Practice</h1>
    <h2>What is a Kata?</h2>
    <p>Kata is structured practice for consistent improvement.
        Originating in martial arts, kata are structured routines consisting of patterns.</p>

    <p>In this set of katas we will be practicing using for loops in Javascript</p>

    <p>The structure for the for loop will be consistent and there will be certain patterns that you will notice as you
        go through each kata. For example the conditions for your for loop in the will be really similar for each kata.
        You will just need to change you're start conditions, stop condition, and step condition for each.</p>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <p>
        The first kata is complete. Use the first one as an example on writing the other for loops for the other katas.
        To see code you will need to use live server extension. Install this extension using the extension tab on the
        left hand side of the IDE. Search Live Server and click install.
        Next open with live server at by clicking Go Live at the bottom of VS Code. You can also open the html by right
        clicking the html in the Explorer section and clicking "Open with Live Server".
        Once the browser window opens you will be able to see this text on the screen. To run the code right click and
        choose inspect. Once the dev tools opens up choose the console tab. You're JS logs should be here.
